# Introduction
This project is about estimating the background in the data with Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) method.

## Gaussian Process Regression
Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is a powerful statistical modeling technique used for regression analysis. It is a non-parametric Bayesian approach that can effectively capture complex patterns and relationships in data.

In GPR, the underlying assumption is that the data points are drawn from a Gaussian process, which is a collection of random variables where any finite subset follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution. This makes GPR a flexible and versatile method for modeling various types of data. The key idea behind GPR is to model the relationship between input variables (predictors) and output variables (response) as a continuous function. Unlike traditional regression methods that assume a fixed functional form, GPR provides a flexible framework that can adapt to the data by capturing both the mean and uncertainty in the predictions.
