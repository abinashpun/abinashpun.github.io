This webpage is currently under construction.

Welcome to my personal webpage. I am a Ph. D. in experimental high energy nuclear physics from Ohio University. Currently, I am a post-doctoral research associate at New Mexico State University, working on the SpinQuest experiment at Fermi National Lab.

SpinQuest at Fermilab is intended to explore properties of the proton's spin composition. Many of the physical and chemical processes depend greatly on the interactions of subatomic particles and their spin. Understanding the origin protonâ€™s spin will help us to better know about the strongest force in the nature. Protons are comprised of different valence quarks, sea quarks and gluons. The experiment is particularly focused on exploring the sea quark's contribution towards the total spin of proton. 

I am taking the lead role in maintaing and co-ordinating the development of common analysis software framework for the experiment. The software provides effiecient and common methods for the reconstruction, simulation and analysis framework for the experiment (can also be used in verious other high energy physics experiments). 

I am also leading data management project for the experiment. This project is focused on submitting and maintaining the grid jobs for the decoded data produced from the experiment.
