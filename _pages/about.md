Greetings! Thank you for visiting my personal webpage. As a lead modeler at Discover Financial Services, I bring over a decade of experience in programming, software development and modeling. My main focus is on developing and implementing sophisticated statistical models and algorithms to identify fraudulent behavior. By leveraging my skills and experience, I aim to enhance Discover's ability to protect its customers and mitigate risks associated with fraudulent behavior.

Prior to my tenure at Discover, I pursued a Ph.D. in high-energy experimental nuclear physics at Ohio University. My doctoral research delved into the analysis of data from Brookhaven National Lab, aimed at comprehending the state of our universe microseconds post-Big Bang.

Subsequently, I transitioned to a role as a postdoctoral researcher at New Mexico State University, where I actively participated in SpinQuest and SeaQuest nuclear experiments at Fermi National Lab. Within these experiments, I held a leadership position, overseeing the maintenance and coordinating the development of a shared analysis software framework.

Within the SpinQuest experiment, I hold a leadership position in maintaining and coordinating the development of a shared analysis software framework. This framework offers efficient and standardized methods for reconstructing, simulating, and analyzing data in the experiment. It has the potential to be utilized in various other high-energy physics experiments as well. The framework is built using **C++** (ROOT CERN). Additionally, I oversee the management of the **data pipeline**, ensuring the integrity of the data for analysis. Moreover, I have been involved in developing **Monte Carlo-based models** to gain insights into and analyze the detector response to elementary particles produced in the experiment.

Furthermore, I am engaged in data analysis for the SeaQuest experiment at Fermilab. Specifically, my focus lies in studying the angular decay coefficients of J/Psi resulting from proton and Iron collisions. To extract the desired signal accurately and account for detector acceptance and resolution, I employ various data-driven methods such as **Data Unfolding** and **Gaussian Process Regression**.

Welcome to my personal webpage. I am a post-doctoral researcher at New Mexico State University with decade long experience of programming, software development and big-data analysis. Currently, I am working on multiple projects of the SeaQuest and the [SpinQuest](https://spinquest.fnal.gov/)  experiments at Fermi National Lab.


[SpinQuest](https://spinquest.fnal.gov/) at Fermilab is intended to explore properties of the proton's spin composition. Many of the physical and chemical processes depend greatly on the interactions of subatomic particles and their spin. Understanding the origin protonâ€™s spin will help us to better know about the strongest force in the nature. Protons are comprised of different valence quarks, sea quarks and gluons. The experiment is particularly focused on exploring the sea quark's contribution towards the total spin of proton. 


I am taking the lead role in **maintaing and co-ordinating the development of common analysis software framework** for the SpinQuest experiment. The software provides effiecient and common methods for the reconstruction, simulation and analysis framework for the experiment (can also be used in verious other high energy physics experiments). The software is based on **C++**(ROOT CERN). Also, I am managing **data pipleline** for analyzing data for integrity check. Furthermore, various MonteCarlo based models were developed to understand and analyze the detectorresponse for elementry particles produced in the experiment.

In addition, I am **analyzing data from SeaQuest experiment** at Fermilab. In particular, I am studying the angular decay coefficients of J/Psi from proton and Iron collision. I am using various data driven methods **(Data Unfolding, Gaussian Process Regression)** to extract the desired signal and to correct the detector acceptance and resolution.
