Welcome to my personal webpage. I am a post-doctoral researcher at New Mexico State University with decade long experience of programming, software development and big-data analysis. Currently, I am working on multiple projects of the SeaQuest and the [SpinQuest](https://spinquest.fnal.gov/)  experiments at Fermi National Lab.

<!---
[SpinQuest](https://spinquest.fnal.gov/) at Fermilab is intended to explore properties of the proton's spin composition. Many of the physical and chemical processes depend greatly on the interactions of subatomic particles and their spin. Understanding the origin protonâ€™s spin will help us to better know about the strongest force in the nature. Protons are comprised of different valence quarks, sea quarks and gluons. The experiment is particularly focused on exploring the sea quark's contribution towards the total spin of proton.

I am taking the lead role in **maintaing and co-ordinating the development of common analysis software framework** for the SpinQuest experiment. The software provides effiecient and common methods for the reconstruction, simulation and analysis framework for the experiment (can also be used in verious other high energy physics experiments). The software is based on **C++**(ROOT CERN). Also, I am managing **data pipleline** for analyzing data for integrity check. Furthermore, various MonteCarlo based models were developed to understand and analyze the detectorresponse for elementry particles produced in the experiment.

In addition, I am **analyzing data from SeaQuest experiment** at Fermilab. In particular, I am studying the angular decay coefficients of J/Psi from proton and Iron collision. I am using various data driven methods **(Data Unfolding, Gaussian Process Regression)** to extract the desired signal and to correct the detector acceptance and resolution.
