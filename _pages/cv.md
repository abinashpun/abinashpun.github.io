Education
======
* Ph.D. in High Energy Experimental Nuclear Physics, Ohio University, USA (2019)
* M.S. in Physics, Ohio Unversity, USA (2016)
* M.Sc. in Physics, Tribhuvan University, Nepal (2012)
* B.Sc. in Physics, Tribhuvan University, Nepal (2009)


Experience
======
* <ins>**Post-Doctoral Researcher** (Aug 2019- current)<ins>
   * Analyzing the production mechanism of an elementary particle from collision experiment at Fermilab.
      - Estimated background noise in data with **Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)** method. Montecarlo simulation technique is used to validate the background elimination process.
      - Developed “mixing method” framework to estimate the combinatorial background (random combination of tracks mimicking real signal).
      - Implemented data driven methods for **data unfolding ( Iterative Bayesian, Singular Value Decomposition, Iterative Dynamically Stabilized, Gaussian Process)** to correct the resolution and limited acceptance of the detector.
   * Working on future experiment at Fermilab to measure an intrinsic property (spin) of a subatomic particle (proton).
      - Leading the effort in **development and maintenance of the analysis software framework** (C/C++ based).
      - Implemented **Kalman Filter Algorithm** and developed energy loss model for reconstruction of particle track.
      - Developed model to estimate the realistic distribution of interaction vertices of particles across the beam volumes.
      - Developed model to simulate the full background produced in experiment.
      - Managing **data Pipeline** and analyzing data for integrity check. **Bash scripts** were written and
run as **cron job** for the purpose.
      - Implemented the use of **singularity container** of the analysis software to run the grid jobs at different cluster in OSG (Open Scince Grid) and Fermilab Grid.
      - Created the optimized set of hit pattern, **Trigger Road-sets**, to record the desired signal in the experiment. As enormous amount of data are produced in high rate, not all the data can be recorded.
      - Developed a framework to reconstruct interaction vertex of tracks with **Deep Neural Network (PyTorch)**.
