Education
======
* Ph.D. in High Energy Experimental Nuclear Physics, Ohio University, USA (2019): GPA = 3.795
* M.S. in Physics, Ohio Unversity, USA (2016): : GPA = 3.759
* M.Sc. in Physics, Tribhuvan University, Nepal (2012)
* B.Sc. in Physics, Tribhuvan University, Nepal (2009)


Experience
======
* <ins>**Lead Modeler**, Discover Financial Services (Aug 2023- current)<ins>
   * Developing fraud detection models 

* <ins>**Post-Doctoral Researcher**, New Mexico State University (Aug 2019- July 2023)<ins>
   * Analyzing the production mechanism of an elementary particle from collision experiment at Fermilab.
      - Estimated background noise in data with **Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)** method. Montecarlo simulation technique is used to validate the background elimination process.
      - Developed “mixing method” framework to estimate the combinatorial background (random combination of tracks mimicking real signal).
      - Implemented data driven methods for **data unfolding ( Iterative Bayesian, Singular Value Decomposition, Iterative Dynamically Stabilized, Gaussian Process)** to correct the resolution and limited acceptance of the detector.
   * Working on future experiment at Fermilab to measure an intrinsic property (spin) of a subatomic particle (proton).
      - Leading the effort in **development and maintenance of the analysis software framework** (C/C++ based).
      - Implemented **Kalman Filter Algorithm** and developed energy loss model for reconstruction of particle track.
      - Developed model to estimate the realistic distribution of interaction vertices of particles across the beam volumes.
      - Developed model to simulate the full background produced in experiment.
      - Managing **data Pipeline** and analyzing data for integrity check. **Bash scripts** were written and
run as **cron job** for the purpose.
      - Implemented the use of **singularity container** of the analysis software to run the grid jobs at different cluster in OSG (Open Scince Grid) and Fermilab Grid.
      - Created the optimized set of hit pattern, **Trigger Road-sets**, to record the desired signal in the experiment. As enormous amount of data are produced in high rate, not all the data can be recorded.
      - Developed a framework to reconstruct interaction vertex of tracks with **Deep Neural Network (PyTorch)**.

* <ins>**Graduate Researcher**, Ohio University (Aug 2013- Aug 2019)<ins>
   * Analyzed data from collision experiment at Brookhaven Lab. The goal of the analysis was to help better understand the state (Quark Gluon Plasma, QGP) of our early universe In particular, measured azimuth angle correlation of two particles to study the energy loss behavior due to the presence of QGP.
      - Performed QA (Quality Analysis) of data, identified and separated the particles (photons and hadrons) of interest and corrected the data for limited detector acceptance
      - Measured the observable to quantify the two particle correlation in the azimuthal angle difference between them. The result provided the hint of the production of QGP in the collision
      - Performed various simulation checks were made to rule out the contributions of other physics in the obtained result.
   * Performed various simulation study for the Detector Design at Brookhaven Lab.
      - Evaluated different Clustering Algorithms to collect the hits deposited by single particle in detector.
      - Performed position dependent calibration of detector (Electromagnetic Calorimeter).
      - Contributed towards the software for detector design and analysis.z
