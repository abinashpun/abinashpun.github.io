An **algorithm** is a set of steps for solving a specific problem, while a **data structure** is a method for organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. **Programming** is a realization of algorithms and data structures, and how to use them affects the performance of a system.

# How to measure algorithm performance
- Method
    - Experimental (Machine-Dependent): measure the execution time of a program
    - Analytical (Machine-Independent): measure the number of steps of execution

- Evaluation metric of analyitical approach: Complexity
    - Space complexity: Required memory size (static+dynamic)
        - Static: predetermined size by a program
        - Dynamic: varies depending on the number of input data
    - Time complexity: The number of steps of execution. We care about both the average and the worst (longest).
    - Both complexities are functions of the number of input data sizes, up to the leading order: Big O expression, O(n)

# Big O Notation

The "O" in Big O notation is used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's running time. Big O notation only provides an upper bound on an algorithm's running time, and actual running times may be faster in practice.

-   `O(1)`: Constant time. 
-   `O(log n)`: Logarithmic time. 
-   `O(n)`: Linear time.
-   `O(n log n)`: Log-linear time. 
-   `O(n^2)`: Quadratic time. 
-   `O(n^3)`: Cubic time. 
-   `O(2^n)`: Exponential time.

# Memory structure for a program
Once you execute a program, the program is loaded into the memory. 
Then processor read data and commands in memory to operate.
The memory allocated during this process has the following structure. 
- Code: For code (execution commands). The memory size is fixed at compile. The memory is allocated (released)  at the beginning (end) of the program.
- Data: For global, static variables. The memory size is fixed at compile. The memory is allocated (released) at the beginning (end) of the program.
- Heap: For dynamic memory allocation. The memory size changes over runtime.
- Stack: For local variables and parameters. The memory size is fixed at compile. The memori is allocated (released) when a function is called.


# Where the choice of a data structure makes a difference?
- Memory size
- Speed at creation 
- Speed of insertion/deletion of a node
- Speed of search

### Structure
- A collection of relevant data.
- Different members of a structure can have different data types.
- A structure can have a member whose data type is a pointer of itself (self referential structure). Such pointer member variable is called a "link" because it links the other structure instance(s) to its own.

### Node
- An element of a data structure is called a node.
- Every node contains data and a link(s) to another node(s).
- Different data structures have different node structures.
