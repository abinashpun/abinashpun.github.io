An **algorithm** is a set of steps for solving a specific problem, while a **data structure** is a method for organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. **Programming** is a realization of algorithms and data structures, and how to use them affects the performance of a system.

# How to measure algorithm performance
- Method
    - Experimental (Machine-Dependent): measure the execution time of a program
    - Analytical (Machine-Independent): measure the number of steps of execution

- Evaluation metric of analyitical approach: Complexity
    - Space complexity: Required memory size (static+dynamic)
        - Static: predetermined size by a program
        - Dynamic: varies depending on the number of input data
    - Time complexity: The number of steps of execution. We care about both the average and the worst (longest).
    - Both complexities are functions of the number of input data sizes, up to the leading order: Big O expression, O(n)

# Big O Notation

Big O notation is a way to describe the efficiency or complexity of an algorithm. It provides a rough estimate of how long an algorithm will take to run, based on the size of the input data.

In computer science, the "O" in Big O notation is used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's running time.

Several common complexities are described using Big O notation, including:

-   `O(1)`: Constant time. The running time of the algorithm is independent of the size of the input data.

-   `O(log n)`: Logarithmic time. The running time increases logarithmically with the size of the input data.

-   `O(n)`: Linear time. The running time increases linearly with the size of the input data.

-   `O(n log n)`: Log-linear time. The running time increases logarithmically with the size of the input data, but with a smaller coefficient than `O(log n)`.

-   `O(n^2)`: Quadratic time. The running time increases as the square of the size of the input data.

-   `O(n^3)`: Cubic time. The running time increases as the cube of the size of the input data.

-   `O(2^n)`: Exponential time. The running time increases exponentially with the size of the input data.

 Big O notation only provides an upper bound on an algorithm's running time, and actual running times may be faster in practice.
